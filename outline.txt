Brainstorming Topics for Computational Physics Seminars

The goal of these seminars aren’t to “teach python/C++/etc.” Rather, the goal is to introduce awesome tools in data science (in the context of Physics and Astronomy). These seminars will be open to the whole department (faculty included). I do not mind giving some of these lectures, but it would be interesting if we got guest lecturers--such as Dr. Still--to discuss select topics and take questions.

The following ideas are listed in no particular order, they will be ordered later.

Kernel Density Estimation
Gaussian Mixture Models
Applications of Mixture Models
Clustering
Classification
Neural Networks
Introduction to TensorFlow
Introduction to Bayesian statistics
Basics such as Bayes Theorem
Data Visualization
Plotly
Dash
Boken
Ggplot
Seaborn
matplotlib
Github
Version control
Write good, readable code
Good code documentation
Working in a collaboration
Markdown
Jupyter Notebooks
Interactive widgets
Animations
Good contact: Richard Perschke (sp?) or any Belle people
Can be used with BASF2 (Belle 2 Analysis Software Framework)
Basic Numpy and matplotlib
Fitting (intro to scipy and the like)
Overview of Optimization Techniques (i.e.; Newton’s Method, Particle Swarm Optimization, etc.)
Overview of Supervised Learning
Least squares
Nearest neighbors
Statistical learning theory
Function approximation
Model Inference and Averaging
Bootstrap
Maximum Likelihood
Bayesian
EM Algorithm
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for sampling from a posterior
Gibbs sampling
Metropolis sampling
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)
No-U-Turn Sampling (NUTS)
Data Warehouse Implementation and Management
SQL
Sqlite
Sqlalchemy
PostgreSQL
etc.
Building GUIs
PyQt
Bokeh
DASH
Tkinter
Signal Processing
Running C++ code using Python (this might require things like ROOT but that’s a different problem)
Introduce Cython
Website development
Perhaps intro to HTML, JS, CSS--at least enough to use bootstrap css.
Developing static pages
Developing dynamic applications
Introduction to the Django framework


Rough Schedule:
Bi-monthly, ~1 hour meeting time:
Introduction to terminology, necessary math, etc.
Follow along exercises
Overview of other applications
